# Locked page?

This is a lock screen that appears automatically for security and privacy reasons.

You are seeing this page because a period of inactivity was detected during your use of the site. This means you went some time without interacting with the page (such as moving the mouse, clicking, or typing). When that happens, the system assumes you may have stepped away from the device and, as a precaution, locks the current session content.

This lock helps to:

- Protect sensitive information if you are using a shared or public computer
- Prevent unauthorized access while you are away
- Help keep your account secure

## Idle time customization

You can customize the amount of time it takes for the lock screen to appear, according to your preference. You can also disable this feature entirely, if you wish.

These settings are available in your account options, under the preferences or security settings panel.

## How to resume using the site?

To return to normal use of the site, simply complete the requested authentication (for example, by entering your password or performing a quick login). Once your identity is confirmed, you will continue exactly where you left off.
